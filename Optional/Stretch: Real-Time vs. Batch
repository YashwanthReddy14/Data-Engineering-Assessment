Real-Time Ingestion:

Implement a streaming data pipeline (e.g., using Kafka or Azure Event Hub) to capture near-instant updates.
Use change data capture (CDC) to monitor source systems and push changes to the central repository with minimal delay.
BI tool can be set to refresh frequently or use direct live connections.
Batch Processing:

Schedule batch jobs (daily, hourly, etc.) using tools like Apache Airflow or Azure Data Factory.
Batch jobs perform bulk data transfers and transformations during off-peak hours.
Ideal for large datasets where real-time processing is not critical.
