Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Define roles (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Administrator).
Implement database-level permissions ensuring only authorized roles can access sensitive tables.
Use views to mask underlying sensitive data where necessary.
Data Masking & Encryption:

Data Masking: 

Apply data masking for sensitive fields (e.g., patient contact details, payroll amounts) especially when the data is used in non-secure environments.
Encryption:

At Rest: 

Ensure the data warehouse supports encryption (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption in SQL-based systems).
In Transit: 

Use SSL/TLS for data transmission between source systems, the ETL pipeline, and the BI tool.
